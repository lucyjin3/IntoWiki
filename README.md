#Using Simple English Wikipedia, I made a program to allow users to easily search for a specific article of their interest. There are approximately 200,000 articles on the Simple English Wikipedia. Due to the high number of articles, I have created a subset of them to make the data easier to use. Into Wiki displays strongly connected subgraphs of simple Wikipedia in the most proficient way using Python. 
Other tools utilized in this program is Pandas, NetworkX, and MySQL.
